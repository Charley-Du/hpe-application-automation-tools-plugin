    This step is responsible for fetching pull requests from the SCM tool and injecting them to ALM Octane.
    <br>
    Every time pull requests are sent to ALM Octane the last update time is saved. The next time, only pull requests and commits that were updated after this time will be sent to ALM Octane.

    <br>
    <br>
    Supported version of ALM Octane: 15.0.49 and later.
