    This build step discovers UFT tests and external data table in SCM repository and synchronizes corresponding entities to ALM Octane.</br>
    Discovery can done in two ways
    <ul>
        <li>Full sync - Cloned scm repository is scanned and all found tests and data tables is synchronized to ALM Octane.</li>
        <li>ChangeSet sync - Only commits that are related to build are scanned and only affected entities are synchronized.</li>
    </ul>
    By default, full sync is done for first run of the job, and after that only changeSet sync is done.
    If you need to force full sync - define in job boolean parameter "Full sync" and execute the job with this parameter is checked.
    </br>

    If you need to assign discovered test in ALM Octane to some specific test runner, define string parameter "Test Runner ID" and assign to it id of relevant test runner.
